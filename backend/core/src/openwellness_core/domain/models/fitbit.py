"""Connected Fitbit account, and the ``fitbits`` provider contract.

A participant's wearable connection lives in the Mongo ``fitbits``
collection. From opserver Phase 10.1 on, that collection holds two kinds of
record side by side: legacy Fitbit Web API records (no ``provider`` field)
and Google Health API records (``provider: "googleHealth"``). When a
participant migrates, the new Google record supersedes the legacy one
(``supersededAt``/``supersededBy``); the legacy record is kept for audit.

This module is OpenWellness's single statement of that contract, locked in
opserver ``docs/google-health.md`` ("Reference: the contract"). frame and the
scheduler (``schedulernew.common.domain.fitbit_provider``) implement the same
filter documents and selection rule; ``ow_api`` imports them from here.

Why ``None`` rather than ``$exists: false``: a Mongo ``{field: null}`` match
covers both a missing field and an explicit null. A writer that ``$set``s
every field leaves ``supersededAt: null`` on a record rather than no field,
and ``$exists: false`` would hide it. Likewise
``{"provider": {"$ne": "googleHealth"}}`` matches documents with no
``provider`` field, so existing legacy records stay visible to legacy readers.

The filter accessors return a fresh deep copy on every call: the nested
``$ne`` document is mutable, and a caller that edits the returned query must
not change the next caller's filter.

Read scope: ``MongoFitbitRepository.get_by_participant_id`` is the
active-connection lookup and never returns a superseded record.
``get_by_id`` and ``list_all`` (inherited from the base repository) are
audit reads and stay unfiltered by design: they return superseded records.
